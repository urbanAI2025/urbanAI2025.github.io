# Workshop Contest

In the competition, competitors will predict building dynamics on a real-world dataset from multiple buildings. The competition uses Googleâ€™s open-source Smart Building Simulator framework and ensures equal access to compatible public datasets, a lightweight simulator, and example code. This Gym compatible framework lowers the barrier of entry for newcomers and allows for experiments to be run in a Colab Notebook. This competition provides an incentive to anyone with the necessary skills to compete for the $2,500 prize fund and is independent of the workshop paper submissions.
